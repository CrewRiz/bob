# Bob - Advanced AI Assistant

Bob is a sophisticated AI assistant designed to provide intelligent, context-aware interactions while maintaining memory of past conversations and learning from interactions. Built with a modular architecture, Bob combines various AI components to deliver a more natural and effective communication experience.

## 🌟 Features

- **Intelligent Conversation**: Natural language processing for human-like interactions
- **Memory Management**: Maintains context and remembers past interactions
- **Learning Capability**: Improves and adapts based on interactions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management system
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Knowledge Management**: Organized information storage and retrieval
- **Time-Aware**: Contextual understanding of time-based information

## 🏗️ Architecture

Bob is built with a modular architecture consisting of several key components:

- `bob.py` - Core AI assistant implementation
- `computerinteraction.py` - Handles system interactions and I/O
- `memory_manager.py` - Manages conversation history and context
- `knowledge_management.py` - Handles information storage and retrieval
- `learning_manager.py` - Implements learning capabilities
- `reasoning_engine.py` - Processes and analyzes information
- `error_handler.py` - Manages error detection and recovery
- `performance_optimizer.py` - Optimizes system performance
- `time_utils.py` - Handles time-related functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started
